There are plenty of great data mocking libraries available for almost every language and platform. But not everyone is a programmer or has time to learn a new framework. Mockaroo allows you to quickly and easily to download large amounts of randomly generated test data based on your own specs which you can then load directly into your test environment using SQL or CSV formats. No programming is required. If you sign in using your Google account, you can download random data programmatically by saving your schemas and using curl to download data in a shell script via a RESTful url. Mockaroo is my passion project, but it started out of necessity. A few years ago I was leading a team of developers and testers at a startup. We were building an app that tracked biological samples collected during clinical trials and other laboratory experiments. The app had several long, complex workflows that made perfect sense to scientists (hopefully), but most of the developers and testers knew little about the domain.
